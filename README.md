# libmem

## What is libmem

This C library has 5 different dynamic memory allocation schemes, suitable for software and HLS designers (although we intended this for the latter case).

## Why do we need libmem

For a beginner HLS developer wishing to port over designs using dynamic memory, it is not straightforward or easy to migrate designs to a static memory requirement.
With this library, we patch this concern.

## Is there an evaluation sweet?

Yes, I have linked a separate repository which includes a suite of benchmarks (suitable for performance checking with HLS tools)
